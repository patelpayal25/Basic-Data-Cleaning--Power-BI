# Basic-Data-Cleaning--Power-BI
Case study

Adventure Works needs your help to analyze its sales data and create a Power BI report that visualizes this data in a meaningful way. Before the analysis can begin, the raw data must be cleaned and transformed to make sure it's accurate and consistent.

The company sends you the CSV file containing the raw dataset named SalesFile.csv. The dataset consists of important data related to recent sales, such as product categories, manufacturing prices, sales prices, units sold, and other similar details.

However, the file also contains errors like missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting. Help Adventure Works to resolve these issues using Power Query editor so that they can produce an accurate and reliable report.

This exercise aims to assist you in understanding how to address common data issues such as missing values, incorrect data types, and inconsistent formatting.

By the end of this exercise, youâ€™ll understand how to import, clean, and transform data in Power BI Desktop to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.
